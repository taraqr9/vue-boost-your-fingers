# About This Vue.js Project:
This Vue.js project is my personal journey to elevate my skills in Vue.js. The concept draws inspiration from "10fastfingers". While not an extensive application, I intentionally chose a concise idea with ample room for future expansion. A friend, Nazmul, suggested this project as an effective way to deepen my understanding of Vue.js.
